# DevOps Pipeline

This repository is a simple test project to explore how **GitHub Actions** work for continuous integration (CI).

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.js` — Main JavaScript file for the project  
- `test.js` — Basic test script to verify functionality  
- `package.json` — Project configuration and dependencies  
- `.github/workflows/pipeline.yaml` — CI workflow definition for GitHub Actions  

## ⚙️ What It Does
The workflow automatically runs when changes are pushed to the **main** branch.  
It installs dependencies, runs tests, and checks if the project builds successfully.

## 🚀 Purpose
This project serves as a **practice setup** for understanding how to automate testing and integration using GitHub Actions.
